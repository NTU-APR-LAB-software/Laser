1. What type of Motor Controller do you plan to use with PT1-Z8 25 mm (0.98") Motorized Translation Stage? Is this KDC101? (https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2419)

2. Do I understand correctly that two sets (Motor Controller + Motorized Translation Stage) will be used?

3. Regarding scan parameters, what is the meaning of the parameters "Integration Time, s" and "Delay Time, ms"?

4. What parameters do you think should be set in the Photocurrent Mapping mode?
My list for now: 
-Wavelength, nm
-Start X, mm
-Stop X, mm
-Start Y, mm
-Stop Y, mm
