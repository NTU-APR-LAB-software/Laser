Dear Alex,

Hope you have been well during this difficult time.

I would like to add one more functionality to our existing LabView code. Current sequence is:
   1) Change laser wavelength
   2) Wait for a delay time
   3) Obtain data from equipment
   4) Change wavelength

The revised sequence is:
   1) Change laser wavelength
   2) Change wavelength of spectrometer 
   3) Wait for a delay time
   4) Obtain data from equipment
   5) Change wavelength


For 2), I have obtained the relevant documents from manufacturer (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ke3o3az69ms265f/AAAHDSBSJKzT-MS0Bug-8GKQa?dl=0). I can translate any part you require.

Could you please let me know if you can help on this?

A) I can pay you over UpWork
B) I need this to be done in a week or so

Please let me know what you think.

Best regards,
Donguk
