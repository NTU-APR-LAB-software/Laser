Hello,

Please guide me in the right direction. What measurement system architecture should I use to:

- continuously (no breaks) measure current at a given sampling rate (up to 10 kHz) (voltage = const)
- receive measured data in a program on a PC (Labview)

At the moment I don’t have the equipment at hand to verify correct operation. Using the forum and Reference Manual, I created a preliminary script for discussion. 

Do I understand correctly that after running this script data from the equipment will come to the PC 10 times per second?
However, as I understand it, measurements will not be taken during data transmission? How can this be avoided?
Thanks.
